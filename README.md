# Open Impact Mapping Workshop

Facilitation exercises for teaching/running impact mapping sessions.

## Educational Workshops

Training materials and facilitation guides for teaching groups about impact mapping basics:

* [Concerts Online](educational-workshops/concerts-online) - interactive introductory workshop best for groups up to 30-40 people, but also OK for larger groups (Gojko once led a workshop with a group of 150 people at a conference).  Suitable for a half-day or a full-day teaching session. 


## Facilitation Games

Good ideas for helping a group of people produce better impact maps:

* [Revenue Stream Map](facilitation-games/revenue-stream-map)
* [Impact Trump Cards](facilitation-games/impact-trump-cards)
